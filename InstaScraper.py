"""NOTES:
-the file reading system needs to be able to separate lists of accounts. 
Idea: The first line of the .txt file acts as a dictionary. The # character separates each entry, and the character after the # indicates what type of data it is. This is followed
by the username of the person that it's related to. For instance, if #F indicates a follower list, then #FJane_Doe02 would represent the follower list of Jane_Doe02. There should
be a function to create a dictionary using the first line, where the keys are the pound signs with the identifying character and username, and the values are ints that represent
the line numbers in the text file in which the corresponding array of accounts can be found. #F represents a follower list, #f represents a following list.
In the dictionary, the hashtags are omitted, so the keys are preceded by F or f only.
